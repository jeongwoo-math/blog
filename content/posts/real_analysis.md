**Proposition**. The 3-adic representation of the Cantor set can be generalized to the Cantor-like sets.


**Proposition**. The unique countable perfect subset of a complete metric space is the empty set.

*Proof*. Let $A$ be a countable perfect subset of a complete metric space $(X,d)$. It is easy to show that the metric space $(A,d|_{A \times A})$ is also a complete metric space, in particular, it is a Baire space. Since $A$ has no isolated point, it is either empty or countably infinite. Suppose that $A = \lbrace a_i \rbrace _{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is countably infinite. We define open dense subsets $A_j = \lbrace a_i \rbrace_{i \ge j}$ of $A$ for all $j \in \mathbb{N}$. By the definition of Baire space, $\bigcap_{j \in \mathbb{N}} A_j = \empty$ must be dense in $A$, but it is impossible. Hence, $A$ must be the empty set. (More generally, the unique countable Baire space without isolated point is the empty set, and in particular, $\mathbb{Q}$ is not a Baire space.) //
